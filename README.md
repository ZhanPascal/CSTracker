# CSTracker

> An esports tracking platform for League of Legends — player profiles, tournaments, teams, and official competitive data in one place.

CSTracker lets you look up any League of Legends player by their in-game name and tag to view their ranked stats, champion mastery, and profile details. The platform also covers official competitive events with full tournament browsing, team profiles, and player career tracking.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|---|---|
| Backend | Node.js, Express 5, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Zustand, React Router 7 |
| External APIs | Riot Games API, League of Legends DDragon, lol.fandom.com Cargo API, LoL Esports API |

---

## Getting Started (Docker)

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd CSTracker
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your values
docker compose up --build
```

- **App** → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **API Docs (Swagger)** → [http://localhost:5000/api/docs](http://localhost:5000/api/docs)
- **pgAdmin** → [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) (admin@admin.com / admin)

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the project root and fill in:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DB_USER` | PostgreSQL username |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password |
| `RIOT_API_KEY` | Riot Games API key — get one at [developer.riotgames.com](https://developer.riotgames.com) (expires every 24h) |
| `LEAGUEPEDIA_USERNAME` | Leaguepedia bot username (`User@BotName`) |
| `LEAGUEPEDIA_PASSWORD` | Leaguepedia bot password |

> The `DATABASE_URL` is built automatically from `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` — no need to set it manually.

---

## Running in Development (without Docker)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 18, PostgreSQL running locally

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your local DB credentials and API keys
npm install
npx prisma db push
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

> Vite automatically proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:5000` — no CORS setup needed.
>
> The `backend/.env.example` contains all required variables for local dev. In Docker, these are injected by `docker-compose.yml` instead.

---

## API Documentation

The API is documented with **Swagger UI**, accessible at [http://localhost:5000/api/docs](http://localhost:5000/api/docs) when the backend is running. It lists all endpoints with their parameters, request/response schemas, and a "Try it out" button to test them directly.
